# ♟️ Wizard's Chess

Our goal is to make a fully autonomous chess game called "Wizard Chess" that will be played similarly to the Harry Potter movies, utilizing voice recognition, networking, path planning, and computer vision.

All respective code should be placed in the semester you are working in. This will be reformatted once we have all the components and start large scale integration. Create new folders for new code with their respective titles to make sure that everything is organized. Make sure that all code is documented in their own `README.md`.
